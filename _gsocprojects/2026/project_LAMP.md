The Late Antiquity Modeling Project (LAMP) is an international, interdisciplinary research collective. LAMP uses computational methods to reconstruct the embodied experiences of ancient buildings and landscapes. In so doing, the project crafts more accurate and embodied histories of religious communities across geographic and temporal contexts. Of particular interest to LAMP is how these embodied reconstructions might be leveraged to rewrite the history of the first centuries of Christianity. 

Our current project centers on the late antique necropolis of El Bagawat in Egypt’s Kharga Oasis. We are interested in developing machine learning approaches that will: 1) determine the pathways taken between buildings within the site, as well as recovering pathways no longer visible, and 2) allow to determine the visibility and audibility of any given point at the site from a particular location.
