## Description

End-to-end Handwritten Text Recognition (HDR) remains an underexplored field with immense potential for both researchers and consumer platforms. Unlike traditional OCR, HDR recognizes entire documents, capturing text along with structural elements such as layout and reading order. Recent models, such as DAN, have demonstrated significant advancements in whole-document recognition.

This project will focus on applying HDR models to early modern Spanish manuscripts, leveraging transformer-based architectures to improve recognition accuracy. By integrating state-of-the-art machine learning with historical document analysis, we aim to enhance the accessibility of handwritten and printed texts from this period while contributing to the broader field of AI-driven humanities research.

## Duration

**Total project length**: 175 hours

## Task Ideas

- Create a self-supervised AI model capable of performing text recognition.
- Implement transformer-based architectures to enhance model performance.
- Train the model on early modern Spanish manuscripts to handle non-standard printed text.

## Expected Results

- Machine learning models trained to perform text recognition of early modern printed text.
- Achieve at least **80% accuracy** in text extraction from handwritten and printed documents.

## Requirements

- Proficiency in Python.
- Previous experience in Machine Learning.
  
## Difficulty Level

**Advanced**
