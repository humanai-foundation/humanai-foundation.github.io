# **Automating Text Recognition and Transliteration of Historical Documents with Convolutional-Recurrent Architectures**

## **Project Overview**

**Project Title:** Automating Text Recognition and Transliteration of Historical Documents  
**Year:** 2024  
**Organization:** University of Alabama, University of Delhi  
**Project:** RenAIssance

## **Project Description**

Transliteration of text from centuries-old works represents a research area that is underserved by current tools like Adobe Acrobatâ€™s OCR. While these tools can effectively recognize text from modern sources, they struggle with early forms of print, especially manuscripts. This project focuses on the application of hybrid end-to-end models based on Convolutional-Recurrent Architectures (CNN-RNN) to recognize and transliterate text from 17th-century Spanish printed sources.

## **Project Duration**

**Total Length:** 175 hours

## **Key Tasks**

- **Developing a Hybrid End-to-End Model:**  
  Creation of a model based on CNN-RNN architectures capable of performing text recognition from historical documents.
  
- **Training the Model:**  
  Training machine learning models to recognize and extract text from non-standard printed sources.

## **Expected Results**

- **Text Recognition Accuracy:**  
  Achieve at least 80% accuracy in text extraction from 17th-century Spanish printed sources.

## **Requirements**

- **Core Competencies:**  
  - Strong programming skills in Python
  - Familiarity with machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
  - Experience with computer vision or natural language processing

## **Difficulty Level**

**Medium**
